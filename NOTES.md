# Project Notes â€“ Chain of One

## Project Description
Chain of One applies blockchain technology in carbon credit tracking.  
Credits are given when companies or individuals engage in sustainable practices such as tree planting, renewable energy usage, or emission reduction. These credits are stored on the blockchain to ensure transparency and avoid double-claiming.

## Objectives
- Provide **trust** and **transparency** in carbon credit tracking.
- Eliminate **double-counting** through decentralized storage.
- Incentivize organizations to adopt eco-friendly practices.
- Build a model system that can scale from local to global use.

## Challenges & Considerations
- Smart contract deployment on Cardano.  
- Verifying if carbon reduction claims are legit.  
- Making the system user-friendly.  

## Future Features
- Smart contract for credit issuance.  
- Token marketplace.  
- Web dashboard for real-time credit monitoring.
